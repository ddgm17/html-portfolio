        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <h2>Digital Art</h2>

        <p>I've loved to draw for many years, since I was a teen. 
            I started out with traditional art although I did dabble in digital art with programs such as 
            Clip Studio Paint and GIMP. Recently I purchased a Ipad and have been using Procreate for my 
            art alongside traditional art. One of my goals is to start my own small art business, selling 
            prints, stationary and other products with my designs.</p>
        <h2>Gaming</h2>

        <p>I have been gaming for long time too and have played and enjoy many different genres. 
            When I was younger I loved anything that involved puzzles and action (still do!), 
            and to this day Tomb Raider is one of my favourite games series as it combines both of these 
            perfectly. </p>
        <h2>Coding!</h2>
        <img src="../assets/arnold-francisca-f77Bh3inUpE-unsplash.jpg" height="200" alt="laptop with coding program on the screen">
        <p>I have only recently started to learn to code as I would like to change my career someday but I 
            have really fallen in love with it. I never though that coding would be something that I could do, 
            as I had the misconception that I had to be incredibly smart and good at math to do anything of the 
            sort, but to my surprise it's not like that at all, and I've been really enjoying myself. I find it 
            so exciting watching a webpage come together as I code.</p>
